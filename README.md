### Speed Coding Academy

As a founding member at Speed Coding Academy,
with Trongate, companion tools, and these snippets, there is no doubt you can create anything at lightning fast feeds!

Of course, recommendations are always appreciated inside the forum, if you would like some improvements. Guys and gals at the academy, these are your passports to having lighning speed in the sky.

When you use these snippets with Sublime Text within HTML Files, or HTML within PHP, simply use the less than sign(<). As soon you start typing, it will display all the snippets. If it is directly within PHP itself, it should automatically show all of the Trongate Snippets as soon as you type. VSCode snippets will be added after I finish these snippets and will create a "school of Trongate Snippets". Be sure to download the latest snippets!
